# Camel Example Kamelet Chuck Norris

## Introduction

This example shows how you can use an out of the box Kamelet with your Camel applications.

This example uses the Chuck Norris Kamelet that periodically gets a joke from the Chuck Norris internet database.

A Camel routes is _coded_ in the `chuck.yaml` file using the XML DSL that uses the Kamelet,
and log the result from the Kamelet to the console.

## Running the example

Just run the integration via:
```
$ kamel run chuck.yaml
```

You should be able to see the new integration running after some time:
```
$ kamel get
NAME	PHASE	KIT
chuck	Running	kit-bu9d2r22hhmoa6qrtc2g
```

You can then show the logs of the running pod to see the Chuck Norris jokes:

```
$ kamel log chuck
```
