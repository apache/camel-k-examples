# Timer Source to Log Sink

This example shows how to create a simple timer `event source` and a log `event sink`. The timer events emitted are consumed by a simple logging connector which will print out those events.

## Additional requirement for running this example

- You should have Knative properly installed on your cluster ([see installation guide](https://knative.dev/docs/install/))

## Create events source and sink

Let's start by creating the timer event source and log event sink as `kamelets`.
```
$ kubectl apply -f timer-source.kamelet.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f log-sink.kamelet.yaml
```

You can check the newly created `kamelet`s in the list.
```
$ kubectl get kamelets timer-source log-sink

NAME           PHASE
timer-source   Ready
log-sink       Ready
```

## Create channel destination

Let's continue by creating a `knative` destination.
```
$ kubectl apply -f timer-events.yaml
```

## Binding events

We can now bind the timer event source to produce events on the destination with the `timer-source.pipe.yaml` configuration.
```
$ kubectl apply -f timer-source.pipe.yaml
```
In a similar fashion you can bind to the log sink in order to consume those events with the `log-sink.pipe.yaml` configuration.
```
$ kubectl apply -f log-sink.pipe.yaml
```
You can check the newly created bindings listing the `Pipes`.
```
$ kubectl get Pipes

NAME                 PHASE
log-event-sink       Ready
timer-event-source   Ready
```

### Watch the event sink

After a while you will be able to watch the event consumed by the underlying `log-event-sink` integration:

```
$ kamel log log-event-sink
